        <p><b>Strength training burns just as many calories as aerobic training,</b>         
            despite the thought that aerobic training is at a higher heart rate, 
            strength training activates a large amount of muscles and at different
             intensities. Adhering to a proper diet and regular training are just as 
             successful and strengthening as aerobic training.
