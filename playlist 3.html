        <p><b>Running is first of all freedom for the soul,</b>         
			Losing weight through long runs, and of course marathon runs, 
			is definitely possible and this is also a fairly common training goal. 
			But despite everything, the nutritional menu will always be the more 
			significant one and affect body weight and fat percentage more than
			 this or that type of training
